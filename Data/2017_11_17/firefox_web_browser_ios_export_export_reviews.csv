I like the 'night mode' option that is much better now compared to the old that simply dimmed the brightness. There still needs to be a way to edit bookmarks and create folders to them... so that this iOS app is as useful as the desktop version. Also needs to add a way to use Find in PDFs. 

Issue (as of Nov 11 2017): Sometimes images get messed up when scrolling in night mode. 

It would be really cool if the 'containers' feature on the desktop Firefox was added to iOS's version; that would really set iOS's Firefox apart as a great browser. I realize iOS has restrictions so addons might not be allowed by Apple in Firefox; although, those would be really cool too. I hope the developers will take note of this review and I appreciate the open-source and transparent philosophy Firefox has supported over the years.",,,meh,

火狐浏览器手机版各有千秋，先说focus。它的界面干净简洁，可缺乏功能。不能给PC端推送网页不说，登陆浏览网页收藏都不行，退出浏览器后不能记住，退出前未关闭页面。

它的优点只有干净简洁。

而传统的浏览器，不错该有的都有了。可是新建页面广告特别多。和市面上的大多数浏览器一样，首页加载一堆有的没的新闻，尤其是偶尔还要广告混在其中。

它的优点只是功能较为健全（连安卓版的插件都没有），推送网页有时还有一分多钟的延时",Firefox and Firefox Focus difference,"First to say, the browser itself profit difficult, but also need to worry. Firefox browser version has its advantages and disadvantages, first focus. Its interface is clean and concise, lacking in functionality. Can not push the page to the PC side does not say, visit the webpage collection will not work, quit the browser can not remember, did not close the page before exiting. Its advantages are clean and concise. The traditional browser, it is true that some have it. However, many new page ads in particular. Like most browsers in the market, the home page loads a bunch of unwanted news, especially if it is occasionally advertised. Its advantage is only more functional (even the Android version of the plug-ins are not), push the web sometimes have more than a minute delay",,

Ich weiß OpenSource lebt davon das viele ihre Ideen einbringen können. Aber es gibt einen Grund dafür das große Unternehmen ihre GUI nicht alle Nase lang ändern. Und das ist der das man es nicht allen recht machen kann. Den auch wenn nicht jeder euer neues Design so unnötig findet wie ich so haben wir doch alle etwas gemeinsam: der Mensch ist ein Gewohnheitstier.
Ja das neue Design sieht gut aus aber an neuen Funktionen mangelt es. Alles in allem sorgt Version 10 nur dafür das ich mich mal wieder umgewöhnen muss ohne dafür viel Neues zubekommen. Firefox sollte darüber nachdenken ob es klug ist seine GUI weiter aussehen zu lassen wie „Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey“ oder ob ihr eurer Software mal Wiedererkennungswert mit einem festen Gesicht geben wollt.",Version 10,"As a lengthy Firefox user, I can now say again: every time you get used to the new design, it is overturned by you again. I know Open Source lives from the fact that many can bring their ideas. But there is a reason that big companies are not changing their GUI every now and then. And that&#39;s the one that can not please everyone. Even if not everyone finds your new design as unnecessary as I do, we all have something in common: man is a creature of habit. Yes, the new design looks good, but it lacks new features. All in all, version 10 only makes sure that I have to get used to it without getting a lot of new stuff. Firefox should think about whether it&#39;s wise to make their GUI look like &quot;Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey&quot; or if you want to give your software a recognizable look with a solid face.",happy,

3. Add a bookmark and it just simply adds it.... with no initial option to put it where you want it or name it what you want.

4. What happened to tab style option?
  Not a big deal, but I personally liked having the option, and the scrolling list view opposed to the tile view. 

5.  Sites that when clicking a link need to load a separate page/tab by design dont load the link, just a blank page.   Ie:  link clicked, separate tab loads blank ""about:blank"" page.

1. Allow users to make desktop mode the default setting.

2. Allow users to set a default start-up page instead of opening all the tabs that were left open during the previous session.

Another bug is the Night Mode. All Night Mode does is swap black and white for text and backgrounds. The bug is that if the page is already using a black background, Night Mode changes it to white, making the page NOT night-time-viewing friendly.

I've never liked Top Sites, preferring to store my own sites. Although you can pin sites here, you cannot rearrange the order which is annoying. Once you navigate away from Top Sites, Bookmarks etc. there's no simple way to access these unless you open a new tab. A button on the menu bar would solve this. I also like the Safari approach that uses a drop down menu when you click on the search/address bar. I do welcome the tracker blocker but wish we could have an ad blocker too as ads eat into mobile data and take up too much room on smaller screens. Also could do with a 'do not track' request and the option to block 3rd party cookies, which I do on Firefox desktop. I would also like an easier way to delete private data as having to go through several menus before I close the browser is very tedious and irritating - it's a shame mobile devices loose the handy keyboard shortcuts desktop browsers have. Perhaps Firefox iOS could delete private data when you close the browser like the desktop browser does.

Firefox web browser,iOS,989804926,1908855791,USA,10.0,5,2017-11-09,Isaac Gray,Needs UI tweaking and Adblocking integration,"Dear Mozilla,

This is a product with tons of opportunities. The custom search engine script is amazing, and finally allows me to use a custom search query for a trustworthy engine (StartPage). This finally pulls me away from the control of Google. However, some tweaks would make it a better product on iPad and iPhone:

1) Add Adblocking ability from Firefox Focus. I realize that it is no small feat as Apple does not allow Firefox iOS to use the apple scripts for Adblocking, but adopting the block lists to the fully fledged app would be a gift to all.

Update: 9/22/2017. Thank you for adding tracking protection, and at different levels! This is a huge improvement for user privacy and I commend Mozilla for continuing to fight the good fight against tracking.

2) Make bookmarks editable (renamable) and their order organizable. Currently you can only delete or open them in a new tab as options. It's not a mature feature set.

3) Move the new tab button on the tab viewing page from the bottom left to the bottom right. This keeps you from having to travel the diagonal from the tab button (upper right) to the opposite (bottom left) corner, switching hands. Useful on iPad, VERY USEFUL for iPhone use, which is often one handed.

Update 11/9/2017
The good guys at Mozilla DID IT! The new “photon” layout is easier than ever to use! Thanks for listening to users and making the UI more accessible!

4) the pin to top sites feature only allows one link to the domain of choice. If I want to have a link to my Amazon Orders, that will take over the general Amazon.com link. Make this more like the safari Favorites tab! There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Customization, privacy, and autonomy should be the hallmark of Firefox. Not some gimmicky, clunky suggested websites. What if I visit an illicit website and don't want to worry about it poppin up in a new tab?? I get it, use private browsing mode, but the suggested websites panel should be an option you can disable.

Lots of potential, but the app needs some streamlining and more options for the user. Apple locks us down, but Mozilla can potentially set us free.",,,happy,

after simplifying a large number of complex operations on the end of travel, let me such a not-so-novice is also interested in continuing to play. The athleticism and balance have done well enough, the quality of the game is good, and the compatibility is very high, even with a low profile is also very clear. Innovative ability did not have to say that getting started is also particularly simple. Some built-in game is also very useful, selective attack keys, pushing tower and playing soldier can be distinguished. As a novice, you should know how to reflect your mistakes. No newbie is not a pit father, every god grew up from a novice father, the difference is that God know how to gain experience in the failure. Since it is a novice, we must put our attitude, pay more attention to the small map in the game, with the rhythm of close teammates, be careful not to take the regiment, do not be arrested. Even if made a mistake to apologize, I believe your teammates will forgive you. Attention to see a small map, follow the command of his teammates. Novice is not terrible, novice to listen to the command, it will not be pit father novice yo.
