11,iOS,Appbot,2017-11-16,10.1,4.0,"Good update but.... Firefox has definitely improved its UI with the new update. I like the 'night mode' option that is much better now compared to the old that simply dimmed the brightness. There still needs to be a way to edit bookmarks and create folders to them... so that this iOS app is as useful as the desktop version. Also needs to add a way to use Find in PDFs. 

Issue (as of Nov 11 2017): Sometimes images get messed up when scrolling in night mode. 

It would be really cool if the 'containers' feature on the desktop Firefox was added to iOS's version; that would really set iOS's Firefox apart as a great browser. I realize iOS has restrictions so addons might not be allowed by Apple in Firefox; although, those would be really cool too. I hope the developers will take note of this review and I appreciate the open-source and transparent philosophy Firefox has supported over the years.","Good update but....

271,iOS,Appbot,2017-11-09,10.0,5.0,"Needs UI tweaking and Adblocking integration. Dear Mozilla,

This is a product with tons of opportunities. The custom search engine script is amazing, and finally allows me to use a custom search query for a trustworthy engine (StartPage). This finally pulls me away from the control of Google. However, some tweaks would make it a better product on iPad and iPhone:

1) Add Adblocking ability from Firefox Focus. I realize that it is no small feat as Apple does not allow Firefox iOS to use the apple scripts for Adblocking, but adopting the block lists to the fully fledged app would be a gift to all.

Update: 9/22/2017. Thank you for adding tracking protection, and at different levels! This is a huge improvement for user privacy and I commend Mozilla for continuing to fight the good fight against tracking.

2) Make bookmarks editable (renamable) and their order organizable. Currently you can only delete or open them in a new tab as options. It's not a mature feature set.

3) Move the new tab button on the tab viewing page from the bottom left to the bottom right. This keeps you from having to travel the diagonal from the tab button (upper right) to the opposite (bottom left) corner, switching hands. Useful on iPad, VERY USEFUL for iPhone use, which is often one handed.

Update 11/9/2017
The good guys at Mozilla DID IT! The new “photon” layout is easier than ever to use! Thanks for listening to users and making the UI more accessible!

4) the pin to top sites feature only allows one link to the domain of choice. If I want to have a link to my Amazon Orders, that will take over the general Amazon.com link. Make this more like the safari Favorites tab! There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Customization, privacy, and autonomy should be the hallmark of Firefox. Not some gimmicky, clunky suggested websites. What if I visit an illicit website and don't want to worry about it poppin up in a new tab?? I get it, use private browsing mode, but the suggested websites panel should be an option you can disable.

Lots of potential, but the app needs some streamlining and more options for the user. Apple locks us down, but Mozilla can potentially set us free.","Needs UI tweaking and Adblocking integration. Dear Mozilla,

516,iOS,SurveyGizmo,2017-11-12,10.1,,"Bonjour à tous, d'abord je voudrais vous féliciter pour le travail que vous faites, bravo a toute l'équipe. Je tiens à préciser que je connais bien Firefox vu que je l'utilise depuis quelques années déjà sur mon PC au Buro, mais là il s'agit d'un disfonctionement sur Mon iPad Pro. Alors pour décrire ce qui me déplaît dans Firefox, je vous parlerais juste d'un détail qui fait toute la différence, d'ou son importance. Jusqu'ici j'utilisais un ancien logiciel pour consulter  mon site favoris sur mon iPad. mais voilà que ce site me conseille d'utiliser un navigateur plus récent tel que le votre, pour profiter justement des nouvelles mise à jour du site. Sur ce site en question, les liens proposés peuvent pour la plupart être ouvert dans un autre onglet, par une simple pression sur le lien pendant une ou deux seconde, a l'exception de tous les liens qui se trouvent dans un « tableau ». Du coup je suis obligé de continuer à utiliser mon ancien navigateur, le « mini opéra » qui fonctionne parfaitement sur iOS 11 malgré son ancienneté. Du coup je voulais vous faire part de cette remarque vu que je pense pas que ce soit normal qu'un super navigateur tel que Firefox mise à jour puisse être moins performant qu'un ancien navigateur obsolète. Pour info j'utilise un iPad Pro, mise à jour avec  iOS 11, les liens en questions se trouvent sur un site de Paris en ligne, je ne sais pas si j'ai le droit de l'indiquer ici, alors je le note dans l'emplacement prévu ci dessous. Les liens sont donc dans le tableau indiquant le programme du jour pour l'ensemble des courses de la journée. En principe chaque petit rectangle dans ce tableau, correspond à une course dont le détail peut être consulter en cliquant dessus. Mais dans « mini opéra » on peut consulter ces informations dans un d'autre onglet. C'est juste dommage qu'on ne puisse pas le faire avec FireFox. Il est possible que ce disfonctionnement concerne d'autres sites également mais que personne n'a le temps de vous en parler. Alors je vous laisse les liens du site ci dessous si jamais vous avez le temps d'y jeter un Œil ça serait sympa.Encore merci du travail que vous faites.  Remarques : dans le tableau « programme des courses » il faut cliquer sur  « programme en détails » pour que les petits rectangles correspondant aux courses se transforment en liens qu'on puisse ouvert dans d'autres onglets.","Hello everyone, first I would like to congratulate you for the work you do, congratulations to the whole team. I want to clarify that I know Firefox well since I use it for a few years already on my PC at Buro, but here it is a disfunction on My iPad Pro. So to describe what I do not like in Firefox, I&#39;ll just talk about a detail that makes all the difference, hence its importance. So far I used an old software to check my favorite site on my iPad. but now this site advises me to use a newer browser such as yours, to take advantage of the new site update. On this site in question, the proposed links can for the most part be opened in another tab, by simply pressing the link for one or two seconds, with the exception of all the links that are in a &quot;table&quot;. So I&#39;m forced to continue to use my old browser, the &quot;mini opera&quot; that works perfectly on iOS 11 despite its seniority. So I wanted to share with you this remark because I do not think it is normal that a super browser such as Firefox update may be less efficient than an old browser obsolete. For info I use an iPad Pro, updated with iOS 11, the links in question are on a Paris site online, I do not know if I have the right to indicate it here, so I note in the location provided below. The links are in the table showing the program of the day for all the races of the day. In principle each small rectangle in this table, corresponds to a race whose details can be consulted by clicking on it. But in &quot;mini opera&quot; we can consult this information in another tab. It&#39;s just too bad we can not do it with FireFox. It is possible that this dysfunction concerns other sites as well but that nobody has the time to talk to you about it. So I leave you the links of the site below if you ever have the time to take a look it would be nice. Thank you for the work you do. Notes: In the table &quot;racing program&quot; you have to click on &quot;program in details&quot; so that the small rectangles corresponding to the races become links that can be opened in other tabs.",Neutral,"Tabs, Link/URL","Open, Open in new tab, Open in other apps, Update, Use","updat, look, time, click","do congratul, is a disfunct on my ipad pro, talk about a detail, use an old softwar, take advantag of the new site updat, propos link, open in anoth tab, press the link, are in a quot tabl quot, use an ipad pro, are on a pari site onlin, have the right, note in the locat, are in the tabl, show the program of the day, consult this inform in anoth tab, concern other site, has the time, have the time, take a look, quot race program quot, click on quot program in detail, becom link, open in other tab","hello, everyon, the work, congratul, the whole team, a few year, pc, buro, a disfunct, my, ipad, pro, firefox, ll, a detail, the differ, henc, import, an old softwar, favorit site, ipad, this site, browser, your, advantag, the new site, updat, this site, question, link, part, anoth tab, the link, second, the except, the link, a quot, tabl, quot, old browser, the quot, mini, opera, quot, io, senior, share, this remark, browser, firefox, updat, an old browser, obsolet, info, an ipad pro, the link, question, a pari, site, onlin, the right, the locat, the link, the tabl, the program, the day, the race, the day, principl, each small rectangl, this tabl correspond, a race, detail, quot mini, opera, this inform, anoth tab, firefox, this dysfunct, other site, nobodi, the time, the link, the site, the time, a look, thank, the work, note, the tabl, program, quot, quot program, detail, the small rectangl, the race, link, other tab"
