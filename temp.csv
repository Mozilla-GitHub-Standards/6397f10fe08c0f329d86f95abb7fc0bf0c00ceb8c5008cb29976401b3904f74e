I like the 'night mode' option that is much better now compared to the old that simply dimmed the brightness. There still needs to be a way to edit bookmarks and create folders to them... so that this iOS app is as useful as the desktop version. Also needs to add a way to use Find in PDFs. 

Issue (as of Nov 11 2017): Sometimes images get messed up when scrolling in night mode. 

It would be really cool if the 'containers' feature on the desktop Firefox was added to iOS's version; that would really set iOS's Firefox apart as a great browser. I realize iOS has restrictions so addons might not be allowed by Apple in Firefox; although, those would be really cool too. I hope the developers will take note of this review and I appreciate the open-source and transparent philosophy Firefox has supported over the years.","Good update but....
